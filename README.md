# WSL Script

Shell script _(.sh)_ handler for
[Windows Subsystem for Linux](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/about) _(WSL)_.

Registers .sh _(or any other)_ extension to be executed in WSL.
Automatically handles Windows â†’ Unix path conversions.
Files can be dragged and dropped to registered file icon in explorer
to pass paths as arguments.

## Usage

Move `wslscript.exe` file to a location of your choice.
This executable is used to invoke WSL, so don't move the file afterwards.

Run `wslscript.exe` to open a setup GUI.
Click a button to add .sh extension to Windows registry.

After registration, `.sh` files can be executed from explorer by double clicking.
Other files can be passed as path arguments by dragging and dropping them into
`.sh` file icon.

Scripts are executed in the same folder where the script file is located,
ie. `$PWD` is set to script's directory.

Note that Drag & Drop handler may not work until reboot.
